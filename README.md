## Quick Start

Follow the instructions in the [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to complete the installation of the basic environment. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) also needs to be installed.

### Step 1. Creating a New Site

Sign in to GitHub and browse to [**Chirpy Starter**](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/), click the button <kbd>Use this template</kbd> > <kbd>Create a new repository</kbd>, and name the new repository `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

### Step 2. Installing Dependencies

Clone it to your local machine, go to its root directory, and run the following command to install the dependencies. 

```console
$ bundle
```

### Step 3. Running Local Server

Run the following command in the root directory of your site:

```console
$ bundle exec jekyll s
```

Or run with Docker:

```console
$ docker run -it --rm \
    --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
    -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \
    jekyll serve
```

After a few seconds, the local service will be published at _<http://127.0.0.1:4000>_.
