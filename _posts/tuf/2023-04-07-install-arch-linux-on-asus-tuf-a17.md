# Installing Arch Linux on Asus TUF
Arch Linux, a lightweight and flexible LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

## Preparing for Installation

Before you begin the installation process, it's important to prepare your computer and gather the necessary tools:

### Backup Your Data

Installing a new operating system involves wiping your hard drive, so it's important to backup any important data beforehand.

### Check System Requirements

Arch Linux requires a minimum of 512MB RAM and 2GB storage space. Check that your Asus TUF meets these requirements.

### Download Arch Linux ISO

Download the latest Arch Linux ISO image from the official website: (https://archlinux.org/download/) and   

### Create Bootable USB Drive

Create a bootable USB drive with the Arch Linux ISO image using a tool like Rufus or Etcher.

## Installing Arch Linux

Once you've prepared your computer and gathered the necessary tools, you're ready to install Arch Linux on your Asus TUF:

### Step 1: Boot from USB Drive

Insert the USB drive into your Asus TUF and boot from it by accessing the BIOS or UEFI settings and changing the boot order to prioritize the USB drive.

### Step 2: Connect to the Internet

Connect to the internet using the following command:


Replace `<SSID>` with the name of your Wi-Fi network.

### Step 3: Partition the Hard Drive

Use the `fdisk` command to partition your hard drive. Here's an example partition scheme:

| Partition | Size | Type |
| --------- | ---- | ---- |
| /dev/sda1 | 512MB | EFI System |
| /dev/sda2 | 8GB | Linux swap |
| /dev/sda3 | Remaining space | Linux filesystem |

You can use the following commands to create the partitions:

```bash
fdisk /dev/sda
n
p
1
2048
+512M
t
1
n
p
2
1085440
+8G
n
p
3
+8G
w
```

### Step 4: Format the Partitions

Format the partitions using the following commands:

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkswap /dev/sda2
swapon /dev/sda2
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
```

### Step 5: Mount the Partitions

Mount the partitions using the following commands:

```bash
mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

### Step 6: Install Arch Linux

Install Arch Linux using the following command:

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
```


### Step 7: Configure the System

Configure the system by generating the fstab file, chrooting into the new system, and installing some basic tools:

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
arch-chroot /mnt
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/<Region>/<City> /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
nano /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
echo "<Hostname>" > /etc/hostname
nano /etc/hosts
passwd
pacman -S vim networkmanager
systemctl enable NetworkManager
exit
```

Replace `<Region>` and `<City>` with your geographic region and city, and replace `<Hostname>` with your desired hostname.

### Step 8: Install a Bootloader

Install a bootloader, such as GRUB, using the following commands:

```bash
pacman -S grub efibootmgr
```
### Step 9: Configure the Bootloader

Configure the bootloader by generating the GRUB configuration file:

```bash
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=arch_grub
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Step 10: Reboot

Exit the chroot environment and reboot your system:

```bash
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully installed Arch Linux on your Asus TUF! You now have a lightweight and customizable operating system that you can configure to your liking.
