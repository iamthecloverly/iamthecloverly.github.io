OPPO sub-brand Realme has launched its Realme 6 series devices called Realme 6/6i/6s back in 2020 with Realme UI and Android 10+ out of the box. 
Now, if you’re one of the Realme 6 lineup users and encountered the custom firmware flashing issue then the chances are high that either your device gets stuck in 
bootloop or bricked. If the same happens, you can check out steps to Unbrick or Downgrade Realme 6, 6i, and 6S using SP Flash Tool.

Due to the customization craze or having a fully-featured custom firmware, most Android lovers may easily be stuck in the bootloop or bricking issue due to 
any kind of improper firmware flashing method or flashing the incompatible files. Sometimes it may also happen that although you’ve followed a guide, you have 
missed any important step and the problem starts from there. But don’t worry because that’s a normal thing on Android.
