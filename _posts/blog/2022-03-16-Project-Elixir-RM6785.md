# FAQs

**Can I flash this rom from RealmeUI-1.0 or custom ROM based on it?**

    Yes! this build contains RealmeUI-2.0 firmware so doesn’t matter what ROM you are on.

**How to root?**

    Download latest Magisk apk and flash it from RECOVERY.

**I can’t boot into RECOVERY mode after flashing this ROM**

    You can, just not with the key combo. Realme have mapped that combo to bootloader instead of recovery unlike in RealmeUI-1.0.
    Enable Advanced restart from Settings->System->Buttons->Power Menu and use that

**How to flash stuffs in Lineage recovery**

    Use External SDCard or adb sideload

**Can I flash other custom recoveries?**

    Not recommended but Yes, you can. Make sure that recovery is compatible with RealmeUI-2.0, RealmeUI-1.0 based recoveries simply won’t work.

**Safetynet is failing after rooting the device**

    If you are on Magisk 23.0:
        Enable MagiskHide from Magisk Manager app
    If you are on Magisk 24.0+ (Zygisk):
        Enable “Zygisk” option from the Magisk Manager app
        Reboot your device
        Enable “Enforce DenyList” option
        Go in “Configure DenyList”
        Enable “Show system apps” option then search ‘Google Play Services’ and tap on it (but NOT on the tick box!) to expand activities
        Enable “com.google.android.gms” and “com.google.android.gms.unstable”
