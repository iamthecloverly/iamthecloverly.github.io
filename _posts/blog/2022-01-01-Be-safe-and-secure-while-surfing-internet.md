Nowadays we all know that internet is not safe as we think, thousands of people get hacked and scammed daily.
So is there any way to dodge these scammers?
Well, yeah of course there are so many precautions that anyone can take, you don't need be a coder or anything to be secure just some basic knowledge of Internet will do well just follow these steps given below :)

# 1. Don't use your real information on these sites

So, first of all never use same passwords on all different websites for sign up, Specially on weird or non-famous websites, using same email-password on vulnerable-unknown sites can lead your data to be in wrong hands. I'm not saying that these sites sell your data ' the real reason behind not using your real password is these sites are small with we don't know how much secure database. the simple trick would be using different passwords on different websites on the internet , well the reason to not use your main email address would be spam and etc. many people be asking " IF NOT MY EMAIL THEN WHATT?" 
There are so many websites (like MAIL.TM and Temp mail which gives you temporary email addresses which comes so handy while surfing unknown sites on the internet.

# 2. Use VPN on unknown websites.
VPN means virtual private network, using these third party softwares on your computer or mobile phone can hide your real IP-ADDRESS from hackers, stalkers and etc. this small step can make a huge difference and makes you a little anonymous while surfing. well, you can use vpn's to surf internet as citizen of another country that's a real fun too, oh yeah lets get back to the topic you can use any trusted vpn you know but if you're thinking to buy I would personally recommend these after using maximum in the market ( HMA VPN, Express VPN, VYPR VPN, Windscribe) 

# 3. Never Give Your Payment details to creepy mails.
Now, this would be the most sensitive and important part of this article. did you ever get an email saying ' hey, update your payment info. right now to avail 100 bucks' if YES do not open it because I'm pretty sure no one just gives you 100$ for no reason, most of the times these emails are sent by scammers to get your credit card, paypal and other information " HOW TO KNOW IF ITS A SCAMMER OR REALLY SOME LEGIT COMPANY" 
OK! So now, lets just say hypothetical you get an email from Paypal saying update your credit card or your account will be deactivated, first of all check the link they gave you to update your information if it's real it'll be like paypal.com if you see any typo or something weird in the domain never open it.   

**these 3 steps would be kinda enough to be safe from creeps and scammers, article about social media account awareness will be published soon on our website. so stay tuned xD!**
