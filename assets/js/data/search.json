By compiling the kernel yourself, you gain the ability to customize and optimize it for your specific device. Before we begin, make sure you have all the required tools and dependencies installed on your computer.Table of Contents Prerequisites Downloading the Source Code Configuring the Kernel Compiling the Kernel Installing the KernelPrerequisitesTo compile the Android kernel, you’ll need the following tools and dependencies: A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) Git Build-essential package ncurses-dev package Android NDK Android SDKInstall these packages using your preferred package manager.Downloading the Source Code First, create a working directory for the kernel source code:mkdir ~/android_kernelcd ~/android_kernel Clone the Android kernel source code from the official repository:git clone &lt;repository-url&gt; Replace &lt;repository-url&gt; with the correct URL for your device’s kernel.Configuring the Kernel Navigate to the kernel source directory:cd msm Run the following command to configure the kernel:make ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=~/android-ndk-r21d/toolchains/&lt;ndk-path&gt;Replace &lt;ndk-path&gt; with the correct path to your Android NDK on your system. To further customize your kernel, run:make menuconfigThis will open a graphical interface for kernel configuration.Compiling the Kernel To compile the kernel, run:make -j$(nproc) ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=~/android-ndk-r21d/toolchains/&lt;ndk-path&gt;Replace &lt;ndk-path&gt; with the correct path to your Android NDK on your system. Wait for the compilation process to complete. This may take a while depending on your system’s resources.Installing the Kernel Locate the compiled kernel image in the arch/arm64/boot directory. It is usually named &lt;kernel-image&gt;. Copy the kernel image to your pc. Boot into fastboot. Flash the kernel image using the following command: fastboot flash boot &lt;kernel-image&gt; Reboot your device. Done! Congratulations! You have successfully compiled and installed the Android kernel from source. Please note that I’ve replaced and with placeholders. Make sure to replace them with the correct values before using the code.Sources [The Quint] [Youtube] [Ventures Africa] [Technext24] [Twitter] [Hot Hardware] [Tech Spot] [Hackmd] [Fresh Plaza]" }, { "title": "Introduction to Android Kernel", "url": "/posts/Intro-to-Android-kernel/", "categories": "Android Project, Kernel, AOSP", "tags": "Android Project, Kernel, AOSP", "date": "2023-06-08 21:35:00 +0530", "snippet": "IntroductionThe Android kernel is open-source software that runs on Android devices.

The kernel is responsible for managing the hardware and software components of the device. Compiling a custom kernel from source code is a great way to optimize your device’s performance, stability, and battery life. In this post, we will take you through the steps to compile the Android kernel for your device.Newer ACKs (version 5.4 and above) are also known as GKI kernels. GKI kernels support the separation of the hardware-agnostic generic core kernel code and GKI modules from the hardware-specific vendor modules.The GKI kernel interacts with hardware-specific vendor modules containing system on a chip (SoC) and board-specific code. The interaction between the GKI kernel and vendor modules is enabled by the Kernel Module Interface (KMI) consisting of symbol lists identifying the functions and global data required by vendor modules. Figure 1 shows the GKI kernel and vendor module architecture:Figure 1. GKI architecture Note: The GKI kernel, GKI module, and vendor module architecture is the result of a multi-year effort known as the Generic Kernel Image (GKI) project. For information about this project and its phases, refer to The Generic Kernel Image (GKI) project.Kernel glossaryKernel glossaryThis section contains terms used throughout the kernel documentation.Kernel typesAndroid Common Kernel (ACK)A kernel that is downstream of a LTS kernel and includes patches of interest to the Android community that haven’t been merged into Linux mainline or Long Term Supported (LTS) kernels. Newer ACKs (version 5.4 and above) are also known as GKI kernels as they support the separation of hardware agnostic Generic Kernelcode and hardware agnostic GKI modules.Feature KernelA kernel for which the platform release features are guaranteed to be implemented. For example, in Android 12, the two feature kernels were android12-5.4 and android12-5.10. Android 12 features can’t be backported to 4.19 kernels; the feature set would be similar to a device that launched with 4.19 on R and upgraded to S).generic core kernelThe portion of the GKI kernel that is common across all devices.Generic Kernel Image (GKI) kernelAny newer (5.4 and above) ACK kernel (currently aarch64 only). This kernel has two parts: The core GKI kernel with code common across all devices and GKI modules developed by Google that can be dynamically loaded on devices where applicable.Kernel Module Interface (KMI) kernelSee GKI kernelLaunch KernelA kernel that is valid for launching a device for a given Android platform release. For example, in Android 12, the valid launch kernels were 4.19, 5.4, and 5.10.Long Term Supported (LTS) kernelA Linux kernel that’s supported for 2 to 6 years. LTS kernels are released once per year and are the basis for each of Google’s ACKs.Branch typesACK KMI kernel branchThe branch for which GKI kernels are built. For example, android12-5.10 and android13-5.15.Android-mainlineThe primary development branch for Android features. When a new LTS kernel is declared upstream, the corresponding new GKI kernel is branched from android-mainline.Linux mainlineThe primary development branch for the upstream Linux kernels, including LTS kernels.Other termsCertified boot imageThe kernel delivered in binary form (boot.img) and flashed onto the device. This image is certified in the sense that it contains embedded certificates so Google can verify that the device ships with a kernel certified by Google.Dynamically loadable kernel module (DLKM)A module that can be dynamically loaded during device boot depending on the needs of the device. GKI and vendor modules are both types of DLKMs. DLKMs are released in .ko form and can be drivers or can deliver other kernel functionality.GKI projectA Google project addressing kernel fragmentation by separating common core kernel functionality from vendor-specific SoC and board support into loadable modules.Generic Kernel Image (GKI)A boot image certified by Google that contains a GKI kernel built from an ACK source tree and is suitable to be flashed to the boot partition of an Android device.KMIAn interface between the GKI kernel and vendor modules allowing vendor modules to be updated independently of the GKI kernel. This interface consists of kernel functions and global data that have been identified as vendor/OEM dependencies using per-partner symbol listsGKI modulesKernel modules built by Google that can be dynamically loaded on devices where applicable. These modules are built as artifacts of the GKI kernel and are delivered alongside GKI as the system_dlkm_staging_archive.tar.gz archive. GKI modules are signed by Google using the kernel build time key pair and are compatible only with the GKI kernel that they’re built with.Vendor moduleA hardware-specific module developed by a partner and that contains SoC and device-specific functionality. A vendor module is a type of dynamically loadable kernel module." }, { "title": " IoT Live Weather Station Monitoring Using NodeMCU ESP8266 ", "url": "/posts/NodeMCU-Weather-Station-Monitoring-Project/", "categories": "College Project, IoT, NodeMCU, ESP8266, Weather Station", "tags": "NodeMCU, IoT, ESP8266, Weather Station", "date": "2023-06-01 14:26:00 +0530", "snippet": "NodeMCU Weather Station Monitoring ProjectTable of Contents IOT Live Weather Station Monitoring Using NodeMCU ESP8266 What is a Weather Station?

Version control is a way to save changes over time without overwriting previous versions. Being distributed means that every developer working with a Git repository has a copy of that entire repository - every commit, every branch, every file. If you’re used to working with centralized version control systems, this is a big difference!Whether or not you’ve worked with version control before, there are a few things you should know before getting started with Git:Branches are lightweight and cheap, so it’s OK to have many of themGit stores changes in SHA hashes, which work by compressing text files. That makes Git a very good version control system (VCS) for software programming, but not so good for binary files like images or videos.Git repositories can be connected, so you can work on one locally on your own machine, and connect it to a shared repository. This way, you can push and pull changes to a repository and easily collaborate with others.Why Use Git?Version control is very important - without it, you risk losing your work. With Git, you can make a “commit”, or a save point, as often as you’d like. You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you’re working. Commit often and commit early, and you’ll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.There are many version control systems out there - but Git has some major advantages.SpeedLike we mentioned above, Git uses SHA compression, which makes it very fast.Ease of roll backIf you make a mistake, it’s OK! Commits are immutable, meaning they can’t be changed. (Note: You can change history, but it will create new replacement commits instead of editing the existing commits. More on that later!) This means that if you do make a mistake, even on an important branch like main, it’s OK. You can easily revert that change, or roll back the branch pointer to the commit where everything was fine.The benefits of this can’t be overstated. Not only does it create a safer environment for the project and code, but it fosters a development environment where developers can be braver, trusting that Git has their back.Getting Started With GitDepending on your operating system, you may already have Git installed. But, getting started means more than having the software! To get started, it’s important to know the basics of how Git works. You may choose to do the actual work within a terminal, an app like GitHub Desktop, or through GitHub.com. (Note: while you can interact with Git through GitHub.com, your experience may be limited. Many local tools can give you access to the most widely used Git functionalities, though only the terminal will give you access to them all.)There are many ways to use Git, which doesn’t necessarily make it easier! But, the fundamental Git workflow has a few main steps. You can practice all of these in the Introduction to GitHub course.Create a branchThe main branch is usually called main. We want to work on another branch, so we can make a pull request and make changes safely. To get started, create a branch off of main. Name it however you’d like - but we recommend naming branches based on the function or feature that will be the focus of this branch. One person may have several branches, and one branch may have several people collaborate on it - branches are for a purpose, not a person. Wherever you currently “are” (wherever HEAD is pointing, or whatever branch you’re currently “checked out” to) will be the parent of the branch you create. That means you can create branches from other branches, tags, or any commit! But, the most typical workflow is to create a branch from main - which represents the most current production code.Make change (and make a commit)Once you’ve created a branch, and moved the HEAD pointer to it by “checking out” to that branch, you’re ready to get to work. Make the changes in your repository using your favorite text editor or IDE.Next, save your changes. You’re ready to start the commit!To start your commit, you need to let Git know what changes you’d like to include with git add [file].Once you’ve saved and staged the changes, you’re ready to make the commit with git commit -m \"descriptive commit message\"GitHub:GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all of the distributed revision control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features." }, { "title": "PixelPlusUI v5.1 ROM [Android13] Realme 6, 6i, 6s and Realme 7, Narzo 20 Pro, Narzo 30 4G (G90T Series) (RM6785) [OFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/PixelPlusUI-Android13-ROM-RM6785/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "PixelPlusUI, PPUI, RM6785", "date": "2023-01-25 20:33:00 +0530", "snippet": "PixelPlusUI YET ANOTHER PIXEL ROM!Android is one of the most featuristic OS.

Looking for spelling errors, not trusting unknown email addresses, and being wary of overly urgent messages are standard practices. Despite this, phishing remains the most common attack by far, and it’s an effective one, too. In fact, many large-scale ransomware attacks begin as phishing scams. Let’s find out how phishing attacks continue to scam people and how to identify increasingly advanced scams.Phishing Attacks Have Grown More ComplicatedPart of the on-going success of phishing attacks comes from the fact that they’re becoming more complex. The obvious “Nigerian prince” scams of the past are no longer representative of the current threat landscape.In Q2 2020, 77.6% of phishing websites used SSL encryption, which many users look for as a sign of legitimacy. Similarly, 91% of these attacks hack legitimate websites to take their domain validated (DV) certificates. These certificates then make the attacks carry the mark of a validated, authorized business.Clone phishing has also grown more popular. In these attacks, scammers copy a legitimate email to send an exact replica with the link swapped out for a malicious one. If phishers hack into the legitimate sender’s account, there will be no immediate sign that it’s a scam.Spotting Advanced Phishing ScamsPhishers have become more careful about ensuring their messages don’t look like scams. In many cases, it’s virtually impossible to tell that what you’re reading may be a phishing email without more advanced inspection. Considering how 22% of surveyed employees don’t feel obligated to keep their employers’ information safe, that’s a problem.While these advanced scams are concerning, they’re still not perfect. Here are four steps to identifying even a complex phishing attack.1. Analyze Email HeadersIf there are no immediate tells, you can check an email more closely by inspecting its header. To see this in Gmail, click the arrow next to “Reply,” then select “Show original.” In Outlook in the browser, the option will also be in the arrow next to “Reply” but will say: “View message source.”These options will reveal the raw code for the whole email, but the header is just the first text block. Paste the header into an email header analyzer tool like MxToolbox and click “analyze” to make it more readable. The results will show things like a spam score, the email’s source, and the route it took.Even if an email has a low spam score, it could still be phishing. Check the “Received” field to see the route the message took. If it passed through many sites or some of these have unusual domains, it’s likely a scam.The “Authentication-Results” box will show which verification methods the message passed. Look for the word “pass” in all the results. If even one of them shows ‘failed’, don’t trust the email.2. Inspect Links and Domain NamesAnother important step is to inspect any links within the message. Any domain name in the email or the “From” field that varies from an actual company’s name is suspicious, but these checks can go further.Copy and paste domain names and websites into search engines or an analyzer like DomainTools to learn more about them. DomainTools can show when the domain was created, and brand-new domains are likely fraudulent. Googling domains can reveal if other users have reported it as a scam.Many cybercriminals use URL shorteners to hide domains, so always inspect these links before clicking on them. Copy and paste them into a URL checker like getlinkinfo.com or unshorten.it to reveal the full URL. If the full address is long, contains many random characters, or has words unrelated to the legitimate source, it’s likely a scam.3. Look Through the Source CodeIf you’re still unsure about an email, you can perform a more in-depth inspection of its source code. Follow the same steps for analyzing the header, but look at all of the source code instead of just the first block.Use the search feature in your text editor of choice to look for the phrase “http.” This will help you look through the links in the email, even hidden ones. If you see a domain you don’t recognize or that seems suspicious, Google it or put it through DomainTools to inspect it more closely.Even legitimate emails can contain hidden external links. For example, they may use a third-party email marketing service, which will show up in this check. However, a quick inspection of these links will reveal their legitimacy.4. Question Even Trusted SourcesFinally, it’s important never to trust any message fully, even if it comes from a trusted source. Many phishing attacks today start by hacking into a legitimate account, such as the recent “Is it you in the video?” scam on Facebook Messenger.Given the rise in these types of attacks, just because a message comes from a real, trusted source doesn’t mean it’s not phishing. If any message feels off or seems unusual, contact the person by another means to ask if it was them and perform the above steps on the message.Phishing Methods Have Improved but Safety Is Still PossibleWhile the core concepts behind phishing have remained unchanged for decades, these attacks are far more advanced today than they used to be. Following these four steps can help everyone, from CEOs to consumers to stay safe despite sophisticated phishing techniques. As cybercrime rises, this level of scrutiny may become a necessity." }, { "title": "[GUIDE] UNBRICK/DOWNGRADE YOUR REALME 6/6I(INDIA)/6S USING SPFLASH TOOL FOR FREE!", "url": "/posts/Unbrick-RM6785/", "categories": "Guide", "tags": "RM6785, RMX2001", "date": "2022-01-19 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "OPPO sub-brand Realme has launched its Realme 6 series devices called Realme 6/6i/6s back in 2020 with Realme UI and Android 10+ out of the box.

Don’t use your real information on these sitesSo, first of all never use same passwords on all different websites for sign up, Specially on weird or non-famous websites, using same email-password on vulnerable-unknown sites can lead your data to be in wrong hands. I’m not saying that these sites sell your data ‘ the real reason behind not using your real password is these sites are small with we don’t know how much secure database. the simple trick would be using different passwords on different websites on the internet , well the reason to not use your main email address would be spam and etc. many people be asking “ IF NOT MY EMAIL THEN WHATT?” There are so many websites (like MAIL.TM and Temp mail which gives you temporary email addresses which comes so handy while surfing unknown sites on the internet.2. Use VPN on unknown websites.VPN means virtual private network, using these third party softwares on your computer or mobile phone can hide your real IP-ADDRESS from hackers, stalkers and etc. this small step can make a huge difference and makes you a little anonymous while surfing. well, you can use vpn’s to surf internet as citizen of another country that’s a real fun too, oh yeah lets get back to the topic you can use any trusted vpn you know but if you’re thinking to buy I would personally recommend these after using maximum in the market ( HMA VPN, Express VPN, VYPR VPN, Windscribe)3. Never Give Your Payment details to creepy mails.Now, this would be the most sensitive and important part of this article. did you ever get an email saying ‘ hey, update your payment info. right now to avail 100 bucks’ if YES do not open it because I’m pretty sure no one just gives you 100$ for no reason, most of the times these emails are sent by scammers to get your credit card, paypal and other information “ HOW TO KNOW IF ITS A SCAMMER OR REALLY SOME LEGIT COMPANY” OK! So now, lets just say hypothetical you get an email from Paypal saying update your credit card or your account will be deactivated, first of all check the link they gave you to update your information if it’s real it’ll be like paypal.com if you see any typo or something weird in the domain never open it.these 3 steps would be kinda enough to be safe from creeps and scammers, article about social media account awareness will be published soon on our website. so stay tuned xD!Note: any website,application recommended in this article is personally suggested, and this post is made for educational and awareness purpose only.’'’Don’t forget to share it with your friends.If you have question, don’t hesitate to drop them down below in the comment section" }, { "title": "What is RM6785?", "url": "/posts/What-is-RM6785/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "RM6785", "date": "2021-12-19 00:00:00 +0530", "snippet": "RM6785 is a unified codename, it signifies Realme devices using MT6785 (Helio G90T/G95) SoC and it covers: Realme 6, 6i(ONLY INDIAN VARIANT), 6s Realme 7, Narzo 20 Pro and Narzo 30 4G⚠️MUST READ⚠...", "content": "RM6785 is a unified codename, it signifies Realme devices using MT6785 (Helio G90T/G95) SoC and it covers: Realme 6, 6i(ONLY INDIAN VARIANT), 6s Realme 7, Narzo 20 Pro and Narzo 30 4G⚠️MUST READ⚠️Realme 6 users can use EVERYTHING here, while Realme 7/N20P users can ONLY AND ONLY use kernels, recoveries and ROMs based on UI2.0Discussion will be in SEPARATE chats:For Realme 6, 6i, 6s usersFor other RM6785 usersOTHER CHATS ARE for ALL RM6785 Devices:GamingPhotographyOff-Topic" }, { "title": "CipherOS ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/CipherOS-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "CipherOS, RMX2001", "date": "2021-10-31 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "CipherOS is a Android Custom OS, Based On AOSP &amp; Fueled by Lineage, Striving to Provide its Users, A Clean, Bloat free &amp; Sturdy Experience with Minimal Customisation !Changelog Initial bui...", "content": "CipherOS is a Android Custom OS, Based On AOSP &amp; Fueled by Lineage, Striving to Provide its Users, A Clean, Bloat free &amp; Sturdy Experience with Minimal Customisation !Changelog Initial build based on Android 12.Working features: Fingerprint sensor WiFi Bluetooth SELinux RIL (Data,SMS,Calls) Camera Camcorder Audio GPS NFC Sensors Video Playback ZRAM Internal audio recording Faceunlock Safetynet without magisk DT2W EngineerModeKnown issues Night light flickers VoLTE, Wifi callingDownloadsVanilla ONLY - DownloadMirror - ClickHereJoin my telegram channel to get latest updates Click hereSupport group Join NoWHow to Flash ?Instructions1) Boot into custom recovery2) Format data3) Flash latest build4) Reboot your deviceDevice info Kernel - 4.14.x Chipset - Mediatek MT6785 Helio G90TSources Device tree - Click here Kernel source - Click here Thanks to @SamarV121 for Trees" }, { "title": "crDroid v7.12 ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [OFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/crDroid-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "crDroid, RMX2001", "date": "2021-10-29 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "crDroid is designed to improve the performance, reliability and customizability of stock Android.crDroid uses LineageOS as base.

More widely - whether it’s for business or personal use - email aliases can make it much easier to keep your inbox organized and help protect against spam and phishing attacks.If you use Gmail, there’s a simple and often overlooked syntax trick that can give you unlimited Gmail addresses without the hassle of opening multiple accounts. Here’s how it works…How to create Gmail aliases using the + sign When you first sign up for a Gmail account, you choose a username (e.g. johndoe). This username becomes the first part of your email address (johndoe@gmail.com). You can append a plus (+) sign and any combination of characters after your username, but before the @ sign, (e.g. johndoe+abc123@gmail.com). Any emails sent to that address variation will still come to the primary inbox for johndoe@gmail.com. It works because the Google servers do not read the plus sign and anything that comes after it. When someone sends you an email, you’ll be able to see that they’ve used your alias (e.g. the message will show up as being addressed to johndoe+abc123@gmail.com) but it will still land in your primary inbox. This feature also works with Google Workspace accounts. So let’s say one of your Workspace email addresses is johndoe@doesecurity.com. Emails addressed to johndoe+signups@doesecurity.com will go to the same inbox. Why the Gmail plus trick is more useful than the dot trickThere’s a further way to create Gmail aliases using dots. You can add as many dots as you want between characters before the @ sign (e.g. j.o.h.n.d.o.e.@gmail.com and Gmail will still deliver them to your primary inbox.However, if you’re using aliases for testing, message tracking and organization purposes, it helps to be able to put in some explanatory text (e.g. johndoe+bank@gmail.com). Dots alone are harder to work with.Also, the dot trick only works for email addresses ending in @gmail.com. It doesn’t work on Google Workspace accounts.Ways to use email aliasesHere’s a few illustrations of how a Gmail alias can be a useful tool…Take advantage of the same offer twiceLots of online sellers have a sign-up bonus for new customers (e.g. 10% off your first order if you sign up to their newsletter).Companies generally have filters in place to stop you from signing up to the same offer twice. However, if you use a Gmail + alias (together with a new username and a different payment method), you may be able to get around these filters.Check who has your dataWho is this company, and how did they get into my inbox? A Gmail alias can give you answers.Let’s say you’ve just found a brand that seems to roll out lots of cool discounts to its regular subscribers. You’d like to join their mailing list, but you’re suspicious about what they do with customer data.You can subscribe to the list using a dedicated alias (e.g. johndoe+signup01@gmail.com). If everything’s in order, then the only emails you’ll receive using that address will be from the company you signed up to.If other senders are contacting you via that address, then either the original company has given out your details without permission, or else they’ve been hacked, and your data is out in the wild.Limit the impact of a data breachLet’s say one of the companies you’re signed up to has had its customer data hacked. This potentially means that your email address and password are on a database that’s available for purchase over the dark web. Typically, criminals will use software to systematically go through the list, using those credentials to attempt to log into particular sites (e.g. banking platforms).The best way to prevent unlawful access to your accounts is obviously to use unique passwords and multi-factor authentication wherever you can. However, taking a belt and branches approach, if you use aliases for different sites (e.g. yourname+cash@gmail.com for banking and yourname+insta@gmail.com for social), it makes it that little bit harder for the criminals to mount an automated attack.Organize your inboxUsing handy suffixes (e.g. +work, +signup, +vacation), you can set up Gmail filters. For instance, you could configure your inbox so that all messages addressed to yourname+work@gmail.com are labelled ‘work’ and sent to a specific folder. It’s a good way of staying organized when you’ve got lots of business and personal stuff all going into the same inbox.Penetration testingIf you are involved in penetration testing, you often need to test multiple levels of access. If you are using the same email address, it is difficult to track your results. Plus sign aliases can give you an infinite number of variations without the hassle of having to create multiple accounts.These aliases can also be useful when running a social engineering penetration test. For instance, you are told that one of the companies you work for often receives payment requests from a business called xsupplies. So you create an alias (e.g. yourname+xsuppliespayable@gmail.com) to see if any messages you create are opened, clicked or have credentials entered by careless employees.Website testingYou’re building a website for your new cyber security consulting business. You’ve got an email sign-up button on your homepage, sidebar and contact page. You want to make sure each one is working. You can test it by signing up using a different suffix for each one (+home, +side, +contact etc). If there’s a subscription missing from your list, you can immediately tell which button is broken.The beauty of this approach is that you get multiple address variations, without having to open lots of different email accounts.Let me know what ideas you have for using this gmail feature?" }, { "title": "Lineage OS - Fan Edition v11.69 ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/Los-FE-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "Lineage OS, RMX2001, los", "date": "2021-09-21 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "LineageOS Android DistributionA free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform.LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distributi...", "content": "LineageOS Android DistributionA free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform.LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 10, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community.

Things can go wrong in the process, or you might skip a step or two, causing you to lose all of your important data in the process. Luckily, there are apps that aim to help you through this process, like Titanium Backup, but they’re not completely straightforward. If you want something that completely guides you through the process, then Migrate is the app for you.Just like other backup apps, Migrate backs up your app data, APK files, permissions, call logs, messages, and more, but the app also goes to great lengths to ensure a friendly experience throughout the whole switching process.DownloadDownload any of the latest migrate from these links: Stable GPE Google Playstore Edition Beta NG Non Google Playstore EditionBackup Open migrate, take backup of all user apps. Don’t take backup of system apps, it can cause bootloop. Take backup of user apps, data &amp; permissions. In next step take backup of call logs, msg, contacts, default keyboard etc. don’t mess with what you don’t understand. Backup will be saved in internal storage in migrate folder.Restore To restore this backup - First install ROM than GApps (if needed) than Magisk latest than flash backup zips created in migrate folder in sequence. Don’t break this sequence. When phone boots up, a notification will appear saying “migrate package flashed”, click on it to complete restore, if this notification doesn’t appear or you by mistake removed this notification, than you can just click on “migrate helper” app (installed when you flashed TWRP migrate package) and complete the restore process. After restore process completes, uninstall or disable migrate helper app.Step by Step Screenshots FAQ:-If you are facing issues while flashing, refer to this video: https://youtu.be/0Cp6TNayXnM -Full manual extract guide: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=82198185&amp;postcount=1269How is this app different from Titanium backup? This app is a ROM migration tool. It not only backs up app and data, but also contacts, SMS, call logs etc. Moreover, the restoration process also involves flashing via &gt;TWRP. Titanium backup is an excellent app. Migrate just views the restoration process differently.Do I need to download the Migrate app to restore the apps? No. Only your ROM needs to be rooted. The restoration process is handled by a helper app, which deletes itself after restoring everything.Is it necessary to use Magisk? The app works best with Magisk. Other options like Lineage OS su addon causes weird errors like incomplete file copy, etc.All apps are restored from recovery? No. That is not possible. Because Recovery is a completely different environment from Android. Think of it as installing a Windows game from a Linux distro. Instead &gt;from recovery, an app is injected into system which takes up the restore process when android boots up. Most things are automated, so you need not worry much.A quick word on SD card support…SD card support in v2.0 requires a Magisk module “ExSDCard Access Enabler”, made by developer Romain. According to him, this module requires FUSE support on ROMs. FUSE is supported on some ROMs as a legacy feature as Android has moved away from FUSE to SDCARDFS. As such, the current implementation may or may not work based on your device and ROM.If it does not work for you, please wait until either the module developer rewrites the module :p or I find a different implementation :) Thanks for your patience." }, { "title": "HyconOS 4.5 | Elegant | ROM For Realme 7 / Narzo 20 Pro [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/HyconOS-ROM-RMX2151/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "HyconOS, RMX2151", "date": "2021-08-22 00:00:00 +0530", "snippet": "Hycon OS is AOSP Based ROM with many pixel features &amp; Customizations.

Git also needs to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme: Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing. GitHub Fork - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterSign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button Use this template &gt; Create a new repository, and name the new repository USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. GitHub ForkSign in to GitHub to fork Chirpy, and then rename it to USERNAME.github.io (USERNAME means your username).Next, clone your site to local machine. In order to build JavaScript files later, we need to install Node.js, and then run the tool:$ bash tools/init If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will: Check out the code to the latest tag (to ensure the stability of your site: as the code for the default branch is under development). Remove non-essential sample files and take care of GitHub-related files. Build JavaScript files and export to assets/js/dist/, then make them tracked by Git. Automatically create a new commit to save the changes above.Installing DependenciesBefore running local server for the first time, go to the root directory of your site and run:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options: url avatar timezone langCustomizing StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of it.Starting with version 4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, copy the main sass file _sass/jekyll-theme-chirpy.scss into the _sass directory in your site’s source, then create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new value.Customing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined by file _data/assets/cross_origin.yml, and you can replace some of them according to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll serveAfter a few seconds, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using GitHub ActionsThere are a few things to get ready for. If you’re on the GitHub Free plan, keep your site repository public. If you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repository, and your local machine is not running Linux, go the the root of your site and update the platform list of the lock-file: $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux Next, configure the Pages service. Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar. Then, in the Source section (under Build and deployment), select GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu. Push any commits to GitHub to trigger the Actions workflow. In the Actions tab of your repository, you should see the workflow Build and Deploy running. Once the build is complete and successful, the site will be deployed automatically. At this point, you can go to the URL indicated by GitHub to access your site.Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server." }, { "title": "Writing a New Post", "url": "/posts/write-a-new-post/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "writing", "date": "2019-08-08 11:40:00 +0530", "snippet": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and P...", "content": "This tutorial will guide you how to write a post in the Chirpy template, and it’s worth reading even if you’ve used Jekyll before, as many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Adding author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one).&lt;author_id&gt;: name: &lt;full name&gt; twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt; url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then use author to specify a single entry or authors to specify multiple entries:---author: &lt;author_id&gt; # for single entry# orauthors: [&lt;author1_id&gt;, &lt;author2_id&gt;] # for multiple entries---Having said that, the key author can also identify multiple entries. The benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image.![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" } For an SVG, you have to at least specify its width, otherwise it won’t be rendered.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Dark/Light modeYou can make images follow theme preferences in dark/light mode. This requires you to prepare two images, one for dark mode and one for light mode, and then assign them a specific class (dark or light):![Light mode only](/path/to/light-mode.png){: .light }![Dark mode only](/path/to/dark-mode.png){: .dark }ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image at the top of the post, please provide an image with a resolution of 1200 x 630. Please note that if the image aspect ratio does not meet 1.91 : 1, the image will be scaled and cropped.Knowing these prerequisites, you can start setting the image’s attribute:---image: path: /path/to/image alt: image alternative text---Note that the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.For simple use, you can also just use image to define the path.---image: /path/to/image---LQIPFor preview images:---image: lqip: /path/to/lqip-file # or base64 URI--- You can observe LQIP in the preview image of post Text and Typography.For normal images:![Image description](/path/to/image){: lqip=\"/path/to/lqip-file\" }Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %} This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.VideosYou can embed a video with the following syntax:{% include embed/{Platform}.html id='{ID}' %}Where Platform is the lowercase of the platform name, and ID is the video ID.The following table shows how to get the two parameters we need in a given video URL, and you can also know the currently supported video platforms.
