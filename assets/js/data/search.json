We all know that it is Google that provides the Android Platform and its maintenance. Based on which OEMs build their own custom Firmware/Skin/ROM such as Xiaomi’s MIUI, Samsung’s OneUI, OnePlus’ OxygenOS, etc. Due to the fact that Android is an open-source platform, developers can build their own ROM/Firmware/Skin and that is what we commonly refer to as Custom ROM. Unlike OEMs, Custom ROM developers provide frequent updates, a bloatware-free, and ad-free experience with great flexibility when it comes to the usability of the OS.Working features VoLTE, Wifi calling Fingerprint sensor WiFi Bluetooth SELinux RIL (Data,SMS,Calls) Camera Camcorder Audio GPS NFC Sensors Video Playback ZRAM Internal audio recording Faceunlock Safetynet without magisk DT2W EngineerModeKnown issues Native video calling (ViLTE) and Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) USB AudioChangelogv4.8 Update (19-August-2022) August ASB (android-12.1.0_r22) PixelplusUI source upstream Fixed IPv6 tethering Upstreamed kernel to 4.14.290 Updated vendor blobs and firmware images to RMX2002_11.C.19 Fixed youtube lag while playing 1080p/2K video’s Improved Smoothness Misc improvements24th May, 2022 May ASB (android-12.1.0_r5) SELinux Enforcing PixelplusUI source upstream Fixed Auto brightness QS toggle Unlocked Google app weather widgets Improved haptics Improved UI performance Fixed lag on viewfinder in GCam power: Boost min CPU freq to 1618000,1419000 on interaction Drop redundant secure element service14th March, 2022 February Security Patch Passes SafetyNet out-of-the-box Use GcamGo as default Fixed screen flicker Fixed charging info on lockscreen Fixed native screen recorder Fixed offline charging Miscellaneous changes Fixed DRM Widevine L114th October, 2021 January ASB (android-12.0.0_r26) Switched to RUI2 firmware Passes SafetyNet out-of-the-box Improved Gaming performance Unlimited Google Photos storage NFC works now Added LiveDisplay (Display settings) Fixed VOOC charging delay Fixed brightness slider curve Fixed minimum brightness Upstreamed kernel to 4.14.261 Added F2FS supportScreenshots Reporting Bugs Don’t report bugs if you have any custom kernel or module installed Create new issue here or Report it here.

These scams are virtually as old as email itself, but they’ve remained effective despite considerable cybersecurity advancements.Thankfully, as cybersecurity awareness has improved, more people now know how to spot a basic phishing scam. Looking for spelling errors, not trusting unknown email addresses, and being wary of overly urgent messages are standard practices.Despite this, phishing remains the most common attack by far, and it’s an effective one, too. In fact, many large-scale ransomware attacks begin as phishing scams. Let’s find out how phishing attacks continue to scam people and how to identify increasingly advanced scams.Phishing Attacks Have Grown More ComplicatedPart of the on-going success of phishing attacks comes from the fact that they’re becoming more complex. The obvious “Nigerian prince” scams of the past are no longer representative of the current threat landscape.In Q2 2020, 77.6% of phishing websites used SSL encryption, which many users look for as a sign of legitimacy. Similarly, 91% of these attacks hack legitimate websites to take their domain validated (DV) certificates. These certificates then make the attacks carry the mark of a validated, authorized business.Clone phishing has also grown more popular. In these attacks, scammers copy a legitimate email to send an exact replica with the link swapped out for a malicious one. If phishers hack into the legitimate sender’s account, there will be no immediate sign that it’s a scam.Spotting Advanced Phishing ScamsPhishers have become more careful about ensuring their messages don’t look like scams. In many cases, it’s virtually impossible to tell that what you’re reading may be a phishing email without more advanced inspection. Considering how 22% of surveyed employees don’t feel obligated to keep their employers’ information safe, that’s a problem.While these advanced scams are concerning, they’re still not perfect. Here are four steps to identifying even a complex phishing attack.1. Analyze Email HeadersIf there are no immediate tells, you can check an email more closely by inspecting its header. To see this in Gmail, click the arrow next to “Reply,” then select “Show original.” In Outlook in the browser, the option will also be in the arrow next to “Reply” but will say: “View message source.”These options will reveal the raw code for the whole email, but the header is just the first text block. Paste the header into an email header analyzer tool like MxToolbox and click “analyze” to make it more readable. The results will show things like a spam score, the email’s source, and the route it took.Even if an email has a low spam score, it could still be phishing. Check the “Received” field to see the route the message took. If it passed through many sites or some of these have unusual domains, it’s likely a scam.The “Authentication-Results” box will show which verification methods the message passed. Look for the word “pass” in all the results. If even one of them shows ‘failed’, don’t trust the email.2. Inspect Links and Domain NamesAnother important step is to inspect any links within the message. Any domain name in the email or the “From” field that varies from an actual company’s name is suspicious, but these checks can go further.Copy and paste domain names and websites into search engines or an analyzer like DomainTools to learn more about them. DomainTools can show when the domain was created, and brand-new domains are likely fraudulent. Googling domains can reveal if other users have reported it as a scam.Many cybercriminals use URL shorteners to hide domains, so always inspect these links before clicking on them. Copy and paste them into a URL checker like getlinkinfo.com or unshorten.it to reveal the full URL. If the full address is long, contains many random characters, or has words unrelated to the legitimate source, it’s likely a scam.3. Look Through the Source CodeIf you’re still unsure about an email, you can perform a more in-depth inspection of its source code. Follow the same steps for analyzing the header, but look at all of the source code instead of just the first block.Use the search feature in your text editor of choice to look for the phrase “http.” This will help you look through the links in the email, even hidden ones. If you see a domain you don’t recognize or that seems suspicious, Google it or put it through DomainTools to inspect it more closely.Even legitimate emails can contain hidden external links. For example, they may use a third-party email marketing service, which will show up in this check. However, a quick inspection of these links will reveal their legitimacy.4. Question Even Trusted SourcesFinally, it’s important never to trust any message fully, even if it comes from a trusted source. Many phishing attacks today start by hacking into a legitimate account, such as the recent “Is it you in the video?” scam on Facebook Messenger.Given the rise in these types of attacks, just because a message comes from a real, trusted source doesn’t mean it’s not phishing. If any message feels off or seems unusual, contact the person by another means to ask if it was them and perform the above steps on the message.Phishing Methods Have Improved but Safety Is Still PossibleWhile the core concepts behind phishing have remained unchanged for decades, these attacks are far more advanced today than they used to be. Following these four steps can help everyone, from CEOs to consumers to stay safe despite sophisticated phishing techniques. As cybercrime rises, this level of scrutiny may become a necessity." }, { "title": "[GUIDE] UNBRICK/DOWNGRADE YOUR REALME 6/6I(INDIA)/6S USING SPFLASH TOOL FOR FREE!", "url": "/posts/Unbrick-RM6785/", "categories": "Guide", "tags": "RM6785, RMX2001", "date": "2022-01-19 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "OPPO sub-brand Realme has launched its Realme 6 series devices called Realme 6/6i/6s back in 2020 with Realme UI and Android 10+ out of the box.

Don’t use your real information on these sitesSo, first of all never use same passwords on all different websites for sign up, Specially on weird or non-famous websites, using same email-password on vulnerable-unknown sites can lead your data to be in wrong hands. I’m not saying that these sites sell your data ‘ the real reason behind not using your real password is these sites are small with we don’t know how much secure database. the simple trick would be using different passwords on different websites on the internet , well the reason to not use your main email address would be spam and etc. many people be asking “ IF NOT MY EMAIL THEN WHATT?” There are so many websites (like MAIL.TM and Temp mail which gives you temporary email addresses which comes so handy while surfing unknown sites on the internet.2. Use VPN on unknown websites.VPN means virtual private network, using these third party softwares on your computer or mobile phone can hide your real IP-ADDRESS from hackers, stalkers and etc. this small step can make a huge difference and makes you a little anonymous while surfing. well, you can use vpn’s to surf internet as citizen of another country that’s a real fun too, oh yeah lets get back to the topic you can use any trusted vpn you know but if you’re thinking to buy I would personally recommend these after using maximum in the market ( HMA VPN, Express VPN, VYPR VPN, Windscribe)3. Never Give Your Payment details to creepy mails.Now, this would be the most sensitive and important part of this article. did you ever get an email saying ‘ hey, update your payment info. right now to avail 100 bucks’ if YES do not open it because I’m pretty sure no one just gives you 100$ for no reason, most of the times these emails are sent by scammers to get your credit card, paypal and other information “ HOW TO KNOW IF ITS A SCAMMER OR REALLY SOME LEGIT COMPANY” OK! So now, lets just say hypothetical you get an email from Paypal saying update your credit card or your account will be deactivated, first of all check the link they gave you to update your information if it’s real it’ll be like paypal.com if you see any typo or something weird in the domain never open it.these 3 steps would be kinda enough to be safe from creeps and scammers, article about social media account awareness will be published soon on our website. so stay tuned xD!Note: any website,application recommended in this article is personally suggested, and this post is made for educational and awareness purpose only.’'’Don’t forget to share it with your friends.If you have question, don’t hesitate to drop them down below in the comment section" }, { "title": "What is RM6785?", "url": "/posts/What-is-RM6785/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "RM6785", "date": "2021-12-19 00:00:00 +0530", "snippet": "RM6785 is a unified codename, it signifies Realme devices using MT6785 (Helio G90T/G95) SoC and it covers: Realme 6, 6i(ONLY INDIAN VARIANT), 6s Realme 7, Narzo 20 Pro and Narzo 30 4G⚠️MUST READ⚠️Realme 6 users can use EVERYTHING here, while Realme 7/N20P users can ONLY AND ONLY use kernels, recoveries and ROMs based on UI2.0Discussion will be in SEPARATE chats:For Realme 6, 6i, 6s usersFor other RM6785 usersOTHER CHATS ARE for ALL RM6785 Devices:GamingPhotographyOff-Topic" }, { "title": "CipherOS ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/CipherOS-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "CipherOS, RMX2001", "date": "2021-10-31 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "CipherOS is a Android Custom OS, Based On AOSP &amp; Fueled by Lineage, Striving to Provide its Users, A Clean, Bloat free &amp; Sturdy Experience with Minimal Customisation !Changelog Initial build based on Android 12.Working features: Fingerprint sensor WiFi Bluetooth SELinux RIL (Data,SMS,Calls) Camera Camcorder Audio GPS NFC Sensors Video Playback ZRAM Internal audio recording Faceunlock Safetynet without magisk DT2W EngineerModeKnown issues Night light flickers VoLTE, Wifi callingDownloadsVanilla ONLY - DownloadMirror - ClickHereJoin my telegram channel to get latest updates Click hereSupport group Join NoWHow to Flash ?Instructions1) Boot into custom recovery2) Format data3) Flash latest build4) Reboot your deviceDevice info Kernel - 4.14.x Chipset - Mediatek MT6785 Helio G90TSources Device tree - Click here Kernel source - Click here Thanks to @SamarV121 for Trees" }, { "title": "crDroid v7.12 ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [OFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/crDroid-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "crDroid, RMX2001", "date": "2021-10-29 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "crDroid is designed to improve the performance, reliability and customizability of stock Android.crDroid uses LineageOS as base.

More widely - whether it’s for business or personal use - email aliases can make it much easier to keep your inbox organized and help protect against spam and phishing attacks.If you use Gmail, there’s a simple and often overlooked syntax trick that can give you unlimited Gmail addresses without the hassle of opening multiple accounts. Here’s how it works…How to create Gmail aliases using the + sign When you first sign up for a Gmail account, you choose a username (e.g. johndoe). This username becomes the first part of your email address (johndoe@gmail.com). You can append a plus (+) sign and any combination of characters after your username, but before the @ sign, (e.g. johndoe+abc123@gmail.com). Any emails sent to that address variation will still come to the primary inbox for johndoe@gmail.com. It works because the Google servers do not read the plus sign and anything that comes after it. When someone sends you an email, you’ll be able to see that they’ve used your alias (e.g. the message will show up as being addressed to johndoe+abc123@gmail.com) but it will still land in your primary inbox. This feature also works with Google Workspace accounts. So let’s say one of your Workspace email addresses is johndoe@doesecurity.com. Emails addressed to johndoe+signups@doesecurity.com will go to the same inbox. Why the Gmail plus trick is more useful than the dot trickThere’s a further way to create Gmail aliases using dots. You can add as many dots as you want between characters before the @ sign (e.g. j.o.h.n.d.o.e.@gmail.com and Gmail will still deliver them to your primary inbox.However, if you’re using aliases for testing, message tracking and organization purposes, it helps to be able to put in some explanatory text (e.g. johndoe+bank@gmail.com). Dots alone are harder to work with.Also, the dot trick only works for email addresses ending in @gmail.com. It doesn’t work on Google Workspace accounts.Ways to use email aliasesHere’s a few illustrations of how a Gmail alias can be a useful tool…Take advantage of the same offer twiceLots of online sellers have a sign-up bonus for new customers (e.g. 10% off your first order if you sign up to their newsletter).Companies generally have filters in place to stop you from signing up to the same offer twice. However, if you use a Gmail + alias (together with a new username and a different payment method), you may be able to get around these filters.Check who has your dataWho is this company, and how did they get into my inbox? A Gmail alias can give you answers.Let’s say you’ve just found a brand that seems to roll out lots of cool discounts to its regular subscribers. You’d like to join their mailing list, but you’re suspicious about what they do with customer data.You can subscribe to the list using a dedicated alias (e.g. johndoe+signup01@gmail.com). If everything’s in order, then the only emails you’ll receive using that address will be from the company you signed up to.If other senders are contacting you via that address, then either the original company has given out your details without permission, or else they’ve been hacked, and your data is out in the wild.Limit the impact of a data breachLet’s say one of the companies you’re signed up to has had its customer data hacked. This potentially means that your email address and password are on a database that’s available for purchase over the dark web. Typically, criminals will use software to systematically go through the list, using those credentials to attempt to log into particular sites (e.g. banking platforms).The best way to prevent unlawful access to your accounts is obviously to use unique passwords and multi-factor authentication wherever you can. However, taking a belt and branches approach, if you use aliases for different sites (e.g. yourname+cash@gmail.com for banking and yourname+insta@gmail.com for social), it makes it that little bit harder for the criminals to mount an automated attack.Organize your inboxUsing handy suffixes (e.g. +work, +signup, +vacation), you can set up Gmail filters. For instance, you could configure your inbox so that all messages addressed to yourname+work@gmail.com are labelled ‘work’ and sent to a specific folder. It’s a good way of staying organized when you’ve got lots of business and personal stuff all going into the same inbox.Penetration testingIf you are involved in penetration testing, you often need to test multiple levels of access. If you are using the same email address, it is difficult to track your results. Plus sign aliases can give you an infinite number of variations without the hassle of having to create multiple accounts.These aliases can also be useful when running a social engineering penetration test. For instance, you are told that one of the companies you work for often receives payment requests from a business called xsupplies. So you create an alias (e.g. yourname+xsuppliespayable@gmail.com) to see if any messages you create are opened, clicked or have credentials entered by careless employees.Website testingYou’re building a website for your new cyber security consulting business. You’ve got an email sign-up button on your homepage, sidebar and contact page. You want to make sure each one is working. You can test it by signing up using a different suffix for each one (+home, +side, +contact etc). If there’s a subscription missing from your list, you can immediately tell which button is broken.The beauty of this approach is that you get multiple address variations, without having to open lots of different email accounts.Let me know what ideas you have for using this gmail feature?" }, { "title": "Lineage OS - Fan Edition v11.69 ROM For Realme 6/6i/6s (G90T Series) [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/Los-FE-ROM-RMX2001/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "Lineage OS, RMX2001, los", "date": "2021-09-21 12:30:00 +0530", "snippet": "LineageOS Android DistributionA free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform.LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 10, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community.

Things can go wrong in the process, or you might skip a step or two, causing you to lose all of your important data in the process. Luckily, there are apps that aim to help you through this process, like Titanium Backup, but they’re not completely straightforward. If you want something that completely guides you through the process, then Migrate is the app for you.Just like other backup apps, Migrate backs up your app data, APK files, permissions, call logs, messages, and more, but the app also goes to great lengths to ensure a friendly experience throughout the whole switching process.DownloadDownload any of the latest migrate from these links: Stable GPE Google Playstore Edition Beta NG Non Google Playstore EditionBackup Open migrate, take backup of all user apps. Don’t take backup of system apps, it can cause bootloop. Take backup of user apps, data &amp; permissions. In next step take backup of call logs, msg, contacts, default keyboard etc. don’t mess with what you don’t understand. Backup will be saved in internal storage in migrate folder.Restore To restore this backup - First install ROM than GApps (if needed) than Magisk latest than flash backup zips created in migrate folder in sequence. Don’t break this sequence. When phone boots up, a notification will appear saying “migrate package flashed”, click on it to complete restore, if this notification doesn’t appear or you by mistake removed this notification, than you can just click on “migrate helper” app (installed when you flashed TWRP migrate package) and complete the restore process. After restore process completes, uninstall or disable migrate helper app.Step by Step Screenshots FAQ:-If you are facing issues while flashing, refer to this video: https://youtu.be/0Cp6TNayXnM -Full manual extract guide: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=82198185&amp;postcount=1269How is this app different from Titanium backup? This app is a ROM migration tool. It not only backs up app and data, but also contacts, SMS, call logs etc. Moreover, the restoration process also involves flashing via &gt;TWRP. Titanium backup is an excellent app. Migrate just views the restoration process differently.Do I need to download the Migrate app to restore the apps? No. Only your ROM needs to be rooted. The restoration process is handled by a helper app, which deletes itself after restoring everything.Is it necessary to use Magisk? The app works best with Magisk. Other options like Lineage OS su addon causes weird errors like incomplete file copy, etc.All apps are restored from recovery? No. That is not possible. Because Recovery is a completely different environment from Android. Think of it as installing a Windows game from a Linux distro. Instead &gt;from recovery, an app is injected into system which takes up the restore process when android boots up. Most things are automated, so you need not worry much.A quick word on SD card support…SD card support in v2.0 requires a Magisk module “ExSDCard Access Enabler”, made by developer Romain. According to him, this module requires FUSE support on ROMs. FUSE is supported on some ROMs as a legacy feature as Android has moved away from FUSE to SDCARDFS. As such, the current implementation may or may not work based on your device and ROM.If it does not work for you, please wait until either the module developer rewrites the module :p or I find a different implementation :) Thanks for your patience." }, { "title": "HyconOS 4.5 | Elegant | ROM For Realme 7 / Narzo 20 Pro [UNOFFICIAL]", "url": "/posts/HyconOS-ROM-RMX2151/", "categories": "ROMs", "tags": "HyconOS, RMX2151", "date": "2021-08-22 00:00:00 +0530", "snippet": "Hycon OS is AOSP Based ROM with many pixel features &amp; Customizations.

This requires technical knowledge and it’s recommended to keep the google_analytics.pv.* empty unless you have a good reason. If your website has low traffic, the page views count would discourage you to write more blogs. With that said, let’s start with the setup.Set up Google AnalyticsCreate GA account and propertyFirst, you need to set up your account on Google analytics. While you create your account, you must create your first Property as well. Head to https://analytics.google.com/ and click on Start Measuring Enter your desired Account Name and choose the desired checkboxes Enter your desired Property Name. This is the name of the tracker project that appears on your Google Analytics dashboard Enter the required information About your business Hit Create and accept any license popup to set up your Google Analytics account and create your propertyCreate Data StreamWith your property created, you now need to set up Data Stream to track your blog traffic. After you signup, the prompt should automatically take you to create your first Data Stream. If not, follow these steps: Go to Admin on the left column Select the desired property from the drop-down on the second column Click on Data Streams Add a stream and click on Web Enter your blog’s URLIt should look like this:Now, click on the new data stream and grab the Measurement ID. It should look something like G-V6XXXXXXXX. Copy this to your _config.yml file:google_analytics: id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX' # fill in your Google Analytics ID # Google Analytics pageviews report settings pv: proxy_endpoint: # fill in the Google Analytics superProxy endpoint of Google App Engine cache_path: # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionWhen you push these changes to your blog, you should start seeing the traffic on your Google Analytics. Play around with the Google Analytics dashboard to get familiar with the options available as it takes like 5 mins to pick up your changes. You should now be able to monitor your traffic in real time.Setup Page ViewsThere is a detailed tutorial available to set up Google Analytics superProxy. But, if you are interested to just quickly get your Chirpy-based blog display page views, follow along. These steps were tested on a Linux machine. If you are running Windows, you can use the Git bash terminal to run Unix-like commands.Setup Google App Engine Visit https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine Click on Create Application Click on Create Project Enter the name and choose the data center close to you Select Python language and Standard environment Enable billing account. Yeah, you have to link your credit card. But, you won’t be billed unless you exceed your free quota. For a simple blog, the free quota is more than sufficient. Go to your App Engine dashboard on your browser and select API &amp; Services from the left navigation menu Click on Enable APIs and Services button on the top Enable the following APIs: Google Analytics API On the left, Click on OAuth Consent Screen and accept Configure Consent Screen. Select External since your blog is probably hosted for the public. Click on Publish under Publishing Status Click on Credentials on the left and create a new OAuth Client IDs credential. Make sure to add an entry under Authorized redirect URIs that matches: https://&lt;project-id&gt;.&lt;region&gt;.r.appspot.com/admin/auth Note down the Your Client ID and Your Client Secret.

The errors are self-explanatory and should be easy to fix. If everything went good, you’ll get this screen:Create Google Analytics QueryHead to https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/admin and create a query after verifying the account. GA Core Reporting API query request can be created in Query Explorer.The query parameters are as follows: start-date: fill in the first day of blog posting end-date: fill in today (this is a parameter supported by GA Report, which means that it will always end according to the current query date) metrics: select ga:pageviews dimensions: select ga:pagePathIn order to reduce the returned results and reduce the network bandwidth, we add custom filtering rules 1: filters: fill in ga:pagePath=~^/posts/.*/$;ga:pagePath!@=. Among them, ; means using logical AND to concatenate two rules. If the site.baseurl is specified, change the first filtering rule to ga:pagePath=~^/BASE_URL/posts/.*/$, where BASE_URL is the value of site.baseurl. After Run Query, copy the generated contents of API Query URI at the bottom of the page and fill in the Encoded URI for the query of SuperProxy on GAE.After the query is saved on GAE, a Public Endpoint (public access address) will be generated, and we will get the query result in JSON format when accessing it. Finally, click Enable Endpoint in Public Request Endpoint to make the query effective, and click Start Scheduling in Scheduling to start the scheduled task.Configure Chirpy to Display Page ViewOnce all the hard part is done, it is very easy to enable the Page View on Chirpy theme. Your superProxy dashboard should look something like below and you can grab the required values.Update the _config.yml file of Chirpy project with the values from your dashboard, to look similar to the following:google_analytics: id: 'G-V6XXXXXXX' # fill in your Google Analytics ID pv: proxy_endpoint: 'https://PROJECT_ID.REGION_ID.r.appspot.com/query?id=&lt;ID FROM SUPER PROXY&gt;' cache_path: # the local PV cache data, friendly to visitors from GFW regionNow, you should see the Page View enabled on your blog.Reference Google Analytics Core Reporting API: Filters &#8617; " }, { "title": "Customize the Favicon", "url": "/posts/customize-the-favicon/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "favicon", "date": "2019-08-10 22:04:00 +0530", "snippet": "The favicons of Chirpy are placed in the directory assets/img/favicons/.

In addition, Git is also required to be installed.InstallationCreating a New SiteThere are two ways to create a new repository for this theme: Using the Chirpy Starter - Easy to upgrade, isolates irrelevant project files so you can focus on writing. Forking on GitHub - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to upgrade. Unless you are familiar with Jekyll and are determined to tweak or contribute to this project, this approach is not recommended.Option 1. Using the Chirpy StarterCreate a new repository from the Chirpy Starter and name it &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io, where GH_USERNAME represents your GitHub username.Option 2. Forking on GitHubFork Chirpy on GitHub and rename it to &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io. Please note that the default branch code is in development. If you want the site to be stable, please switch to the latest tag and start writing.And then execute:$ bash tools/init.sh If you don’t want to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append option --no-gh at the end of the above command.The above command will: Removes some files or directories from your repository: .travis.yml files under _posts If the option --no-gh is provided, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, set up the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder .github. Removes item Gemfile.lock from .gitignore. Creates a new commit to save the changes automatically.Installing DependenciesBefore running for the first time, go to the root directory of your site, and install dependencies as follows:$ bundleUsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options: url avatar timezone langCustoming StylesheetIf you need to customize the stylesheet, copy the theme’s assets/css/style.scss to the same path on your Jekyll site, and then add the custom style at the end of the style file.Starting from v4.1.0, if you want to overwrite the SASS variables defined in _sass/addon/variables.scss, create a new file _sass/variables-hook.scss and assign new values to the target variable in it.Customing Static AssetsStatic assets configuration was introduced in version 5.1.0. The CDN of the static assets is defined by file _data/assets/cross_origin.yml, and you can replace some of them according to the network conditions in the region where your website is published.Also, if you’d like to self-host the static assets, please refer to the chirpy-static-assets.Running Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll serveAfter a while, the local service will be published at http://127.0.0.1:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, check out the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starts with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy by Using Github ActionsFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GitHub Pages service.Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build: Ensure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the sample file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name. Ensure your Jekyll site has file tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy it from here to your Jekyll site. Furthermore, if you have committed Gemfile.lock to the repo, and your runtime system is not Linux, don’t forget to update the platform list in the lock file: $ bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux After the above steps, rename your repository to &lt;GH_USERNAME&gt;.github.io on GitHub.Now publish your Jekyll site by: Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files. Browse to your repository on GitHub. Select the tab Settings, then click Pages in the left navigation bar, and then in the section Source of GitHub Pages, select the /(root) directory of branch gh-pages as the publishing source. Remember to click Save before leaving. Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub. Manually Build and DeployOn self-hosted servers, you cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, you should build the site on your local machine and then upload the site files to the server.Go to the root of the source project, and build your site as follows:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site on Docker:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to the target server.UpgradingIt depends on how you use the theme: If you are using the theme gem (there will be gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\" in the Gemfile), editing the Gemfile and update the version number of the theme gem, for example: - gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\", \"~&gt; 3.2\", \"&gt;= 3.2.1\"+ gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\", \"~&gt; 3.3\", \"&gt;= 3.3.0\" And then execute the following command: $ bundle update jekyll-theme-chirpy As the version upgrades, the critical files (for details, see the Startup Template) and configuration options will change. Please refer to the Upgrade Guide to keep your repo’s files in sync with the latest version of the theme. If you forked from the source project (there will be gemspec in the Gemfile of your site), then merge the latest upstream tags into your Jekyll site to complete the upgrade.The merge is likely to conflict with your local modifications. Please be patient and careful to resolve these conflicts.

Even if you have previous experience with Jekyll, this article is worth reading, because many features require specific variables to be set.Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown. If you want to save time of creating files, please consider using the plugin Jekyll-Compose to accomplish this.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in the Front Matter block.Timezone of DateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only set up the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the post’s timezone in variable date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post are designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:---categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]---Author InformationThe author information of the post usually does not need to be filled in the Front Matter , they will be obtained from variables social.name and the first entry of social.links of the configuration file by default. But you can also override it as follows:Add author information in _data/authors.yml (If your website doesn’t have this file, don’t hesitate to create one.)&lt;author_id&gt;: name: &lt;full name&gt; twitter: &lt;twitter_of_author&gt; url: &lt;homepage_of_author&gt;And then set up the custom author in the post’s YAML block:---author: &lt;author_id&gt;--- Another benefit of reading the author information from the file _data/authors.yml is that the page will have the meta tag twitter:creator, which enriches the Twitter Cards and is good for SEO.Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for a specific post, add the following to the post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsThe global switch of comments is defined by variable comments.active in the file _config.yml. After selecting a comment system for this variable, comments will be turned on for all posts.If you want to close the comment for a specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown languages: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesCaptionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_SizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }Starting from Chirpy v4.4.0, height and width support abbreviations (height → h, width → w). The following example has the same effect as the above:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: w=\"700\" h=\"400\" }PositionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of the classes normal, left, and right. Once the position is specified, the image caption should not be added. Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } ShadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN URL by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN URL will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Image PathWhen a post contains many images, it will be a time-consuming task to repeatedly define the path of the images. To solve this, we can define this path in the YAML block of the post:---img_path: /img/path/---And then, the image source of Markdown can write the file name directly:![The flower](flower.png)The output will be:&lt;img src=\"/img/path/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Preview ImageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute path, width, height, and alt for the image:---image: path: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. The above section “Size” also mentions this.Starting from Chirpy v5.0.0, the attributes height and width can be abbreviated: height → h, width → w. In addition, the img_path can also be passed to the preview image, that is, when it has been set, the attribute path only needs the image file name.Starting from Chirpy v5.2.0, the property for the preview image is changed to image.path. If upgrading the theme from a prior version, you will have to update posts’ metadata to use new image property.Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date. Enable by:---pin: true---PromptsThere are several types of prompts: tip, info, warning, and danger. They can be generated by adding the class prompt-{type} to the blockquote. For example, define a prompt of type info as follows:&gt; Example line for prompt.{: .prompt-info }SyntaxInline Code`inline code part`Filepath Hightlight`/path/to/a/file.extend`{: .filepath}Code BlockMarkdown symbols ``` can easily create a code block as follows:```This is a plaintext code snippet.```Specifying LanguageUsing ```{language} you will get a code block with syntax highlight:```yamlkey: value``` The Jekyll tag {% highlight %} is not compatible with this theme.Line NumberBy default, all languages except plaintext, console, and terminal will display line numbers. When you want to hide the line number of a code block, add the class nolineno to it:```shellecho 'No more line numbers!'```{: .nolineno }Specifying the FilenameYou may have noticed that the code language will be displayed at the top of the code block. If you want to replace it with the file name, you can add the attribute file to achieve this:```shell# content```{: file=\"path/to/file\" }Liquid CodesIf you want to display the Liquid snippet, surround the liquid code with {% raw %} and {% endraw %}:{% raw %}```liquid{% if product.title contains 'Pack' %} This product's title contains the word Pack.{% endif %}```{% endraw %}Or adding render_with_liquid: false (Requires Jekyll 4.0 or higher) to the post’s YAML block.Learn MoreFor more knowledge about Jekyll posts, visit the Jekyll Docs: Posts." }, { "title": "Text and Typography", "url": "/posts/text-and-typography/", "categories": "Blogging, Demo", "tags": "typography", "date": "2019-08-08 09:03:00 +0530", "snippet": "This post is to show Markdown syntax rendering on Chirpy, you can also use it as an example of writing.
